# Yet-Another-Renderer

Project to create a 3D renderer library to support other projects of mine. Feel free to clone it for yourself but would be cool to add a little shoutout to this repo :)

Steps
- ✅ Basic algebra sub-library
- ✅ Ray Tracing Renderer
- ⬛ GPU-accelerated Ray Tracing
- ⬛ Support triangle primitives
- ⬛ Optimize with subsampling
- ⬛ Optimize with hierarchical bounding shapes
